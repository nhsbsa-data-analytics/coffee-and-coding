# Coffee and Coding

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This repository will hold all materials for Coffee and Coding sessions held by the NHS Business Services Authority.

The goal of these sessions is to provide a relaxed environment to share new skills and encourage people to pick up the keyboard and learn to code. The sessions will last 45 minutes to 1 hour and should include some kind of hands on code for others to try out your material.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tools

If you are playing along we recommend using the free Posit Cloud Environment, since all the packages needed to run the code will be available. Alternatively, you could clone this repo to your local device.

**Posit Cloud RStudio Environment**

This online tool requires the user to have a free account and will allow a project to be created based on this git repository:

-   [Posit cloud login](https://posit.cloud/content/yours?sort=name_asc)
-   [Guide to using posit cloud](posit%20cloud%20rstudio/Using%20Posit%20Cloud%20RStudio%20environment.pdf)

Once you have the Coffee and Coding project open in Posit Cloud, you can update it from this repository by using the `git pull` command in the Terminal.

### Sessions

We are actively looking for volunteers to plan and host future sessions. Please refer to [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) when adding new content.
