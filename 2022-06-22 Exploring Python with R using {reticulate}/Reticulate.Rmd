```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

## Reticulate

The {reticulate} package integrates Python with R. 
We are going to do simple machine learning 


## Python configuration 

we need to create conda environment and install few packages. `conda_list()` function retuns an R `data.frame`, with  
 returns an R data.frame, with name giving the name of the associated environment, and python giving the path to the Python binary associated with that environment.

```{r check conda list}

conda_list()

```



```{r create my own conda environment}

```
